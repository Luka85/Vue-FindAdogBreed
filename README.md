# Vue-FindAdogBreed

The Vue App with authentication, using JWT and Express.js.

If the user is authenticated, the user is able to search for a specific breed, toggle breed cards or see details about the chosen breed. The user can move between breeds with the navigation buttons.
I tried to use all VueJs core concepts, such as data binding, props, components, Vue router, state management (Pinia).
